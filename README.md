<h2>Conclusion</h2>
While working on this project I faced some obstacles which allowed me to dive deeper into the complexities of web development and broaden my skill set. Along with creating reusable react components, I also learned how to develop endpoints for the back-end API, which enabled communication with the front-end user interface. Through this project, I gained a better understanding of full-stack development and how to incorporate SQL and databases into a larger project.
